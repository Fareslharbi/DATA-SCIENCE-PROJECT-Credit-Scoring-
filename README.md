# Credit Scoring Data Science Project

This project focuses on credit scoring using data science techniques. The goal is to build a model that can predict creditworthiness based on various features and evaluate its performance.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-scoring-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd credit-scoring-project
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about credit applicants and their creditworthiness. It includes various features such as age, income, credit history, loan amount, etc.

Before running the project, make sure to place the dataset file (e.g., `credit_data.csv`) in the project directory.

## Usage

The project consists of several Python scripts, each performing a specific task. Here's an overview of the available scripts and their functionalities:

- `data_exploration.py`: Performs exploratory data analysis on the credit dataset, including data visualization and summary statistics.
- `data_preparation.py`: Handles data preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values, feature engineering, and data transformation.
- `model_training.py`: Trains and evaluates a machine learning model for credit scoring using the preprocessed data.
- `model_evaluation.py`: Performs further evaluation of the trained model using various metrics and generates a classification report.
- `predict.py`: Uses the trained model to predict creditworthiness for new applicants.

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Make sure the dataset file (`credit_data.csv`) is placed in the project directory.

2. Run the `data_exploration.py` script to explore the dataset:
   ```
   python data_exploration.py
   ```

3. Execute the `data_preparation.py` script to preprocess the data:
   ```
   python data_preparation.py
   ```

4. Run the `model_training.py` script to train the credit scoring model:
   ```
   python model_training.py
   ```

5. Execute the `model_evaluation.py` script to evaluate the trained model:
   ```
   python model_evaluation.py
   ```

6. Use the `predict.py` script to make predictions for new applicants:
   ```
   python predict.py
   ```

Feel free to modify and customize the scripts according to your specific requirements.
